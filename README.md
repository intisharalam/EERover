EERoverWebServer contains the latest Arduino file for the rover web server.

Motion_Base_Code is the base code for motor control that was built upon.

UI_Prototypes is the HTML code that was tested before being integrated to server.

EERoverWebServer_Report_ver_Old is the version mentioned in the report that uses chunk based code to send webpage. New version uses Github Pages to directly load scripts and styles using client browser instead of rover web server.
